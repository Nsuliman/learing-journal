### Computers everywhere in ( peopl's buckets , cars , mobiles ... etc ) , when the computers begins the main gal for its is to mainplute the information and to create a **Thinking Machines** to perform a different tasks , that's means to take the input and storage it then processing it to make an output so, that's what make the computers is a computers .
