### Computers everywhere in ( peopl's buckets , cars , mobiles ... etc ) , when the computers begins the main gal for its is to mainplute the information and to create a **Thinking Machines** to perform a different tasks , that's means to take the input and storage it then processing it to make an output so, that's what make the computers is a computers .

# How *INFORMATION* is represnted using electricity ( Data & binary ) :

### The computers on *ONES & ZEROS* , but noone deals with these binary codes but its plays a big role in how computers works on inside because inside its there are a *Wires & circuits* that carry all the information in a computer so , every circuit represent *ON OR OFF* , *YES OR NO* , *true or false* then **Zero Or ONE** so , the single wire called a **BIT** and it is the samllest piece of information a computer can store . 

### At the end tow or three ... wires means a bit which carry more information . 

### The binary number system :  we have two digits zero or one and with these digits we can count any number .

# How Computers use *Circuits* :

### the computer takes the input and proccessing its to output so, to do that and modify the input to get the asked output the computer contains a very tiney electronic components to make a circuit and every circuit takes an electrical signal and flip it *zero flip to one and vice versa* so , complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different result .

# The *FOUR PARTS* of a computer : 

1. CPU - CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT ( calculates information )
2. INPUT ( converts physical input to binary information )
3. OUTPUT ( converts information to physical output )
4. MEMORY ( store information )

# How *SOFTWARE* CONTROLS *HARDWARE* :


### when you look inside the computer you find a lot of ( circuits , chips , wires , speakers , plugs and other stuff) this is the **HARDWARE** but the thing you don't see is the **SOFTWARE** and it is all the computer's programs and codes running on it .
