# A text editor : 

is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software, following the naming of Microsoft Notepad. Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code . 


### In contrast, a text editor only does as its name describes and allows writing and making changes to the text. Once a programmer creates code in a text editor, they can then input the content into command-line windows.

man:Get information or help about a command
apropos:Locate commands by keyword look up
ls:List directory contents
pwd:Path of working directory
cd:Change working directory
mv:Move file or change name
cp:Copy file
mkdir:Make directory
rm:Remove files and directories
mount /mnt/zip:Mount zip disk on directory /mnt/zip
